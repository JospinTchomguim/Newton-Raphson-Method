# Newton-Raphson-Method

In numerical analysis, Newton's method or Newton-Raphson1 method is, in its simplest application, an efficient algorithm for numerically finding an accurate approximation of a zero (or root) of a real function of a real variable . This method owes its name to the English mathematicians Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and Joseph Raphson (perhaps 1648-1715), who were the first to describe it for finding the solutions of a polynomial equation. Thomas Simpson (1710-1761) considerably widens the field of application of the algorithm by showing, thanks to the notion of derivative, how it could be used to calculate a solution of a nonlinear equation, which may not be a polynomial, and a system formed of such equations.

In its modern form, the algorithm can be briefly presented as follows: at each iteration, the function for which a zero is sought is linearized in the current iterate (or point) and the following iterate is taken equal to the zero of the function linearized. This summary description indicates that at least two conditions are required for the proper functioning of the algorithm: the function must be differentiable at the points visited (to be able to linearize the function there) and the derivatives must not cancel there (so that the linearized function has a zero); Added to these conditions is the strong constraint of having to take the first iterate close enough to a regular zero of the function (i.e., in which the derivative of the function does not vanish), so that the convergence of the process is ensured .
